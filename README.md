This project demonstrates how recursion works by using it to count the number of occurrences of a target value in a sorted array. The code uses:
Binary Search to locate one instance of the target
Recursive expansion to explore left and right neighbors
Base cases to prevent index errors
Return-value chaining to pass results back up the call stack
Although the approach is not the most optimal way to count duplicates, it provides a great hands-on example for those learning recursion
